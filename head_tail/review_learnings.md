# Got a review of my code from Dinesh;

**Things he ponted out**

- If might apper as a good option at first but, it will block the fucture prospect of enhancement in the code.
- A lot of change needs to be done just to add a new feature.
- Should use object tricks `EXTENDED BELOW`.
  - Objects can reduce the `if` conditions.
  - Objects can be used to define `functions`.
  - Objects can be used to store `constants`.
  - Objects can be used to transfer `data`.
  - Easy to access with the help of keys.
