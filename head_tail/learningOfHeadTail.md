# Trying to list my leaning of this assingment.

**Coding related learnings**

- Try to abstract all the functions, in such a way that it can be easily tested.
- Properly write the test cases.
- Use the new methods.
  - `describe` first time used in this one.
  - Learned about `afterall, afterEach and same for before`
  - Properly writing a todo.

**Points to Remember**

- When working with data try to extract as much as you can, loosing data is always bad.
- Don't try to make it work for everything in the get go, work for the logic first.
- We can't test the main so try to use already tested functions in the main.
- Do the check nearest to the place of existance.

# Points told to me:

- If their is an error exit with an exit code.
- Keep the information in data format for richer use
- Try to keep the message as a separate entity such that it can be tested
- Change data only before displaying.
- Flow should stop when their is an error.
