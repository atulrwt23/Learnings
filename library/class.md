# Class

- A class is a book of recipes / or a blueprint for the set of provided data to be operated on.

**Methods / fields**

- The operations that are described at the initiation of the class are the methods or fields.
- They are isolated functions in the class description.

**private fields**

- In the constructor the fields can be assigned a value and be hidden away.
- Such that it cannot be modified by outside intervention.

**My observations**

- A constructor is mostly used to put the keys and initial values.
- new is the main culprit of the formation of the instance from the defination.
- new disregards the return value from the constructor.
- this is the main object of operations in the class.
